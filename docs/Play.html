			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">I think this coming summer the King of Sicilia means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.</p>
			<p class="character">Archidamus</p>

			<p class="character">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose">Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge: we cannot with such magnificence, in so rare- I know not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks, that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience, may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse us.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="verseline">You pay a great deal too dear for whatâ€™s given freely.</p>
			<p class="character">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose">Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">Sicilia cannot show himself overkind to Bohemia. They were trainâ€™d together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now. Since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made separation of their society, their encounters, though not personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts, letters, loving embassies; that they have seemâ€™d to be together, though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embracâ€™d as it were from the ends of opposed winds. The heavens continue their loves!</p>
			<p class="character">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose">I think there is not in the world either malice or matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable comfort of your young Prince Mamillius; it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came into my note.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">I very well agree with you in the hopes of him. It is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old hearts fresh; they that went on crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to see him a man.</p>
			<p class="character">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Would they else be content to die?</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should desire to live.</p>
			<p class="character">Archidamus</p>
			<p class="prose">If the King had no son, they would desire to live on crutches till he had one.</p>

			<p class="verseline">We were as twinnâ€™d lambs that did frisk iâ€™ thâ€™ sun</p>

			<p class="verseline">Was innocence for innocence; we knew not</p>
			<p class="verseline">The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dreamâ€™d</p>
			<p class="verseline">That any did. Had we pursuâ€™d that life,</p>

			<p class="character">Hermione</p>

			<p class="verseline">As fat as tame things. One good deed dying tongueless</p>
			<p class="verseline">Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.</p>

			<p class="verseline">My last good deed was to entreat his stay;</p>
			<p class="verseline">What was my first? It has an elder sister,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or I mistake you. O, would her name were Grace!</p>
			<p class="verseline">But once before I spoke to thâ€™ purpose- When?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, let me haveâ€™t; I long.</p>
			<p class="character">Leontes</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, that was when</p>

Would any but these boilâ€™d brains of nineteen and two and twenty hunt this weather? They have scarâ€™d away two of my best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find than the master.

A pretty one; a very pretty one- sure, some scape. Though I am not bookish, yet I can read waiting-gentlewoman in the scape. This has been some stair-work, some trunk-work, some behind-door-work; they were warmer that got this than the poor thing is here.

			<p class="prose">I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land! But I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the sky; betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust a bodkinâ€™s point.</p>
			<p class="character">Shepherd</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, boy, how is it?</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages, how it takes up the shore! But thatâ€™s not to the point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls! Sometimes to see â€˜em, and not to see â€˜em; now the ship boring the moon with her mainmast, and anon swallowed with yeast and froth, as youâ€™d thrust a cork into a hogshead. And then for the land service- to see how the bear tore out his shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help, and said his name was Antigonus, a nobleman! But to make an end of the ship- to see how the sea flap-dragonâ€™d it; but first, how the poor souls roared, and the sea mockâ€™d them; and how the poor gentleman roared, and the bear mockâ€™d him, both roaring louder than the sea or weather.</p>

			<p class="character">Clown</p>

			<p class="prose">Now bless thyself; thou metâ€™st with things dying, I with things new-born. Hereâ€™s a sight for thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squireâ€™s child! Look thee here; take up, take up, boy; openâ€™t.</p>
			<p class="verseline">So, letâ€™s see- it was told me I should be rich by the fairies.</p>
			<p class="verseline">This is some changeling. Openâ€™t. Whatâ€™s within, boy?</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">Youâ€™re a made old man; if the sins of your youth are forgiven you, youâ€™re well to live. Gold! all gold!</p>
			<p class="character">Shepherd</p>
			<p class="prose">This is fairy gold, boy, and â€˜twill prove so. Up withâ€™t, keep it close. Home, home, the next way! We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go. Come, good boy, the next way home.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">Go you the next way with your findings. Iâ€™ll go see if the bear be gone from the gentleman, and how much he hath eaten. They are never curst but when they are hungry. If there be any of him left, Iâ€™ll bury it.</p>
			<p class="character">Shepherd</p>
			<p class="prose">Thatâ€™s a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that which is left of him what he is, fetch me to thâ€™ sight of him.</p>

			<p class="prose">I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate: â€˜tis a sickness denying thee anything; a death to grant this.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">It is fifteen years since I saw my country; though I have for the most part been aired abroad, I desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent King, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling sorrows I might be some allay, or I oâ€™erween to think so, which is another spur to my departure.</p>
			<p class="character">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose">As thou lovâ€™st me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of thy services by leaving me now. The need I have of thee thine own goodness hath made. Better not to have had thee than thus to want thee; thou, having made me businesses which none without thee can sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute them thyself, or take away with thee the very services thou hast done; which if I have not enough considered- as too much I cannot- to be more thankful to thee shall be my study; and my profit therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal country Sicilia, prithee, speak no more; whose very naming punishes me with the remembrance of that penitent, as thou callâ€™st him, and reconciled king, my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen and children are even now to be afresh lamented. Say to me, when sawâ€™st thou the Prince Florizel, my son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not being gracious, than they are in losing them when they have approved their virtues.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">Sir, it is three days since I saw the Prince. What his happier affairs may be are to me unknown; but I have missingly noted he is of late much retired from court, and is less frequent to his princely exercises than formerly he hath appeared.</p>
			<p class="character">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose">I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some care, so far that I have eyes under my service which look upon his removedness; from whom I have this intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a most homely shepherd- a man, they say, that from very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>
			<p class="prose">I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a daughter of most rare note. The report of her is extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.</p>
			<p class="character">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="prose">Thatâ€™s likewise part of my intelligence; but, I fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not appearing what we are, have some question with the shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not uneasy to get the cause of my sonâ€™s resort thither. Prithee be my present partner in this business, and lay aside the thoughts of</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sicilia.</p>
			<p class="character">Camillo</p>

I know this man well; he hath been since an ape-bearer; then a process-server, a bailiff; then he compassâ€™d a motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinkerâ€™s wife within a mile where my land and living lies; and, having flown over many knavish professions, he settled only in rogue.

			<p class="character">Florizel</p>
			<p class="verseline">These your unusual weeds to each part of you</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do give a life- no shepherdess, but Flora</p>
			<p class="verseline">Peering in Aprilâ€™s front. This your sheep-shearing</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is as a meeting of the petty gods,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And you the Queen onâ€™t.</p>
			<p class="character">Perdita</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, my gracious lord,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To chide at your extremes it not becomes meâ€”</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, pardon that I name them! Your high self,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The gracious mark oâ€™ thâ€™ land, you have obscurâ€™d</p>
			<p class="verseline">With a swainâ€™s wearing; and me, poor lowly maid,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Most goddess-like prankâ€™d up. But that our feasts</p>
			<p class="verseline">In every mess have folly, and the feeders</p>
			<p class="verseline">Digest it with a custom, I should blush</p>
			<p class="verseline">To see you so attirâ€™d; swoon, I think,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To show myself a glass.</p>
			<p class="character">Florizel</p>
			<p class="verseline">I bless the time</p>
			<p class="verseline">When my good falcon made her flight across</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy fatherâ€™s ground.</p>
			<p class="character">Perdita</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now Jove afford you cause!</p>
			<p class="verseline">To me the difference forges dread; your greatness</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath not been usâ€™d to fear. Even now I tremble</p>
			<p class="verseline">To think your father, by some accident,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Should pass this way, as you did. O, the Fates!</p>
			<p class="verseline">How would he look to see his work, so noble,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how</p>
			<p class="verseline">Should I, in these my borrowed flaunts, behold</p>
			<p class="verseline">The sternness of his presence?</p>
			<p class="character">Florizel</p>
			<p class="verseline">Apprehend</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Humbling their deities to love, have taken</p>
			<p class="verseline">The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter</p>
			<p class="verseline">Became a bull and bellowâ€™d; the green Neptune</p>
			<p class="verseline">A ram and bleated; and the fire-robâ€™d god,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As I seem now. Their transformations</p>
			<p class="verseline">Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires</p>
			<p class="verseline">Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts</p>
			<p class="verseline">Burn hotter than my faith.</p>

			<p class="verseline">O, but, sir,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Your resolution cannot hold when â€˜tis</p>
			<p class="verseline">Opposâ€™d, as it must be, by thâ€™ powâ€™r of the King.</p>
			<p class="verseline">One of these two must be necessities,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which then will speak, that you must change this purpose,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or I my life.</p>
			<p class="character">Florizel</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou dearest Perdita,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With these forcâ€™d thoughts, I prithee, darken not</p>
			<p class="verseline">The mirth oâ€™ thâ€™ feast. Or Iâ€™ll be thine, my fair,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or not my fatherâ€™s; for I cannot be</p>
			<p class="verseline">Mine own, nor anything to any, if</p>

			<p class="verseline">Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing</p>

			<p class="character">Servant</p>
			<p class="prose">O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the door, you would never dance again after a tabor and pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you. He sings several tunes faster than youâ€™ll tell money; he utters them as he had eaten ballads, and all menâ€™s ears grew to his tunes.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">He could never come better; he shall come in. I love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing indeed and sung lamentably.</p>
			<p class="character">Servant</p>
			<p class="prose">He hath songs for man or woman of all sizes; no milliner can so fit his customers with gloves. He has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate burdens of dildos and fadings, â€˜jump her and thump herâ€™; and where some stretch-mouthâ€™d rascal would, as it were, mean mischief, and break a foul gap into the matter, he makes the maid to answer â€˜Whoop, do me no harm, good manâ€™- puts him off, slights him, with â€˜Whoop, do me no harm, good man.â€™</p>
			<p class="character">Polixenes</p>

			<p class="character">Servant</p>
			<p class="prose">He hath ribbons of all the colours iâ€™ thâ€™ rainbow; points, more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can learnedly handle, though they come to him by thâ€™ gross; inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns. Why he sings â€˜em over as they were gods or goddesses; you would think a smock were she-angel, he so chants to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square onâ€™t.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="verseline">Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.</p>

			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="prose">Hereâ€™s one to a very doleful tune: how a usurerâ€™s wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a burden, and how she longâ€™d to eat addersâ€™ heads and toads carbonadoâ€™d.</p>
			<p class="character">Mopsa</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is it true, think you?</p>

			<p class="character">Dorcas</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bless me from marrying a usurer!</p>
			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="prose">Hereâ€™s the midwifeâ€™s name toâ€™t, one Mistress Taleporter, and five or six honest wives that were present. Why should I carry lies abroad?</p>

			<p class="prose">Come on, lay it by; and letâ€™s first see moe ballads; weâ€™ll buy the other things anon.</p>
			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="prose">Hereâ€™s another ballad, of a fish that appeared upon the coast on Wednesday the fourscore of April, forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this ballad against the hard hearts of maids. It was thought she was a woman, and was turnâ€™d into a cold fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that lovâ€™d her. The ballad is very pitiful, and as true.</p>
			<p class="character">Dorcas</p>

			<p class="verseline">Letâ€™s have some merry ones.</p>
			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="prose">Why, this is a passing merry one, and goes to the tune of â€˜Two maids wooing a man.â€™ Thereâ€™s scarce a maid westward but she sings it; â€˜tis in request, I can tell you.</p>
			<p class="prose">Mopsa can both sing it. If thouâ€™lt bear a part, thou shalt hear; â€˜tis in three parts.</p>
			<p class="character">Dorcas</p>

			<p class="prose">Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad, knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring, to keep my pack from fasting. They throng who should buy first, as if my trinkets had been hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer; by which means I saw whose purse was best in picture; and what I saw, to my good use I remembâ€™red. My clown, who wants but something to be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the wenchesâ€™ song that he would not stir his pettitoes till he had both tune and words, which so drew the rest of the herd to me that all their other senses stuck in ears. You might have pinchâ€™d a placket, it was senseless; â€˜twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a purse; I would have filâ€™d keys off that hung in chains. No hearing, no feeling, but my sirâ€™s song, and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this time of lethargy I pickâ€™d and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man come in with whoobub against his daughter and the Kingâ€™s son and scarâ€™d my choughs from the chaff, I had not left a purse alive in the whole army.</p>

I see this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive. What an exchange had this been without boot! What a boot is here with this exchange! Sure, the gods do this year connive at us, and we may do anything extempore. The Prince himself is about a piece of iniquity- stealing away from his father with his clog at his heels.

But what talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries are to be smilâ€™d at, their offences being so capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain men, what you have to the King.

I will bring these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him. If he think it fit to shore them again, and that the complaint they have to the King concerns him nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far officious; for I am proof against that title, and what shame else belongs toâ€™t.

			<p class="verseline">Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd deliver the manner how he found it; whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this, methought I heard the shepherd say he found the child.</p>
			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="verseline">I would most gladly know the issue of it.</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">I make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes I perceived in the King and Camillo were very notes of admiration. They seemâ€™d almost, with staring on one another, to tear the cases of their eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language in their very gesture; they lookâ€™d as they had heard of a world ransomâ€™d, or one destroyed. A notable passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest beholder that knew no more but seeing could not say if thâ€™ importance were joy or sorrow- but in the extremity of the one it must needs be.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">[Enter another Gentleman]</h2>
			<p class="verseline">Here comes a gentleman that happily knows more. The news, Rogero?</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">Nothing but bonfires. The oracle is fulfillâ€™d: the Kingâ€™s daughter is found. Such a deal of wonder is broken out within this hour that ballad-makers cannot be able to express it.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">[Enter another Gentleman]</h2>
			<p class="prose">Here comes the Lady Paulinaâ€™s steward; he can deliver you more.How goes it now, sir? This news, which is callâ€™d true, is so like an old tale that the verity of it is in strong suspicion. Has the King found his heir?</p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by circumstance. That which you hear youâ€™ll swear you see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle of Queen Hermioneâ€™s; her jewel about the neck of it; the letters of Antigonus found with it, which they know to be his character; the majesty of the creature in resemblance of the mother; the affection of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding; and many other evidences- proclaim her with all certainty to be the Kingâ€™s daughter. Did you see the meeting of the two kings?</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="verseline">No.</p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">Then you have lost a sight which was to be seen, cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one joy crown another, so and in such manner that it seemâ€™d sorrow wept to take leave of them; for their joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes, holding up of hands, with countenance of such distraction that they were to be known by garment, not by favour.Our king, being ready to leap out of himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that joy were now become a loss, cries â€˜O, thy mother, thy mother!â€™ then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his daughter with clipping her. Now he thanks the old shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten conduit of many kingsâ€™ reigns. I never heard of such another encounter, which lames report to follow it and undoes description to do it.</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried hence the child?</p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">Like an old tale still, which will have matter to rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear open: he was torn to pieces with a bear. This avouches the shepherdâ€™s son, who has not only his innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="verseline">What became of his bark and his followers?</p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">Wreckâ€™d the same instant of their masterâ€™s death, and in the view of the shepherd; so that all the instruments which aided to expose the child were even then lost when it was found. But, O, the noble combat that â€˜twixt joy and sorrow was fought in Paulina! She had one eye declinâ€™d for the loss of her husband, another elevated that the oracle was fulfillâ€™d. She lifted the Princess from the earth, and so locks her in embracing as if she would pin her to her heart, that she might no more be in danger of losing.</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">The dignity of this act was worth the audience of kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">One of the prettiest touches of all, and that which anglâ€™d for mine eyes- caught the water, though not the fish- was, when at the relation of the Queenâ€™s death, with the manner how she came toâ€™t bravely confessâ€™d and lamented by the King, how attentivenes wounded his daughter; till, from one sign of dolour to another, she did with an â€˜Alas!â€™- I would fain say- bleed tears; for I am sure my heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed colour; some swooned, all sorrowed. If all the world could have seenâ€™t, the woe had been universal.</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="verseline">Are they returned to the court?</p>
			<p class="character">Third Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">No. The Princess hearing of her motherâ€™s statue, which is in the keeping of Paulina- a piece many years in doing and now newly performâ€™d by that rare Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself eternity and could put breath into his work, would beguile nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her ape. He so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of answer- thither with all greediness of affection are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</p>
			<p class="character">Second Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">I thought she had some great matter there in hand; for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever since the death of Hermione, visited that removed house. Shall we thither, and with our company piece the rejoicing?</p>
			<p class="character">First Gentleman</p>
			<p class="prose">Who would be thence that has the benefit of access? Every wink of an eye some new grace will be born. Our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge. Letâ€™s along.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">[Exeunt Gentlemen]</h2>
			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="prose">Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me, would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old man and his son aboard the Prince; told him I heard them talk of a fardel and I know not what; but he at that time over-fond of the shepherdâ€™s daughter- so he then took her to be- who began to be much sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of weather continuing, this mystery remained undiscoverâ€™d. But â€˜tis all one to me; for had I been the finder-out of this secret, it would not have relishâ€™d among my other discredits.</p>

			<p class="character">Clown</p>

And so we wept; and there was the first gentleman-like tears that ever we shed.</p>

			<p class="prose">Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are gentlemen.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>

			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, an it like your good worship.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">Give me thy hand. I will swear to the Prince thou art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</p>
			<p class="character">Shepherd</p>
			<p class="verseline">You may say it, but not swear it.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and franklins say it: Iâ€™ll swear it.</p>
			<p class="character">Shepherd</p>
			<p class="verseline">How if it be false, son?</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">If it be neâ€™er so false, a true gentleman may swear it in the behalf of his friend. And Iâ€™ll swear to the Prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be drunk. But Iâ€™ll swear it; and I would thou wouldst be a tall fellow of thy hands.</p>
			<p class="character">Autolycus</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will prove so, sir, to my power.</p>
			<p class="character">Clown</p>
			<p class="prose">Ay, by any means, prove a tall fellow. If I do not wonder how thou darâ€™st venture to be drunk not being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the Queenâ€™s picture. Come, follow us; weâ€™ll be thy good masters.</p>

			<p class="verseline">O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort</p>
			<p class="verseline">That I have had of thee!</p>
			<p class="character">Paulina</p>
			<p class="verseline">What, sovereign sir,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I did not well, I meant well. All my services</p>
			<p class="verseline">You have paid home; but that you have vouchsafâ€™d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With your crownâ€™d brother and these your contracted</p>
			<p class="verseline">Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,</p>
			<p class="verseline">It is a surplus of your grace, which never</p>

			<p class="character">Leontes</p>
			<p class="verseline">O Paulina,</p>
			<p class="verseline">We honour you with trouble; but we came</p>
			<p class="verseline">To see the statue of our queen. Your gallery</p>
			<p class="verseline">Have we passâ€™d through, not without much content</p>
			<p class="verseline">In many singularities; but we saw not</p>
			<p class="verseline">That which my daughter came to look upon,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The statue of her mother.</p>
			<p class="character">Paulina</p>
			<p class="verseline">As she livâ€™d peerless,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So her dead likeness, I do well believe,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Comes it not something near?</p>
			<p class="character">Leontes</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her natural posture!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she</p>
			<p class="verseline">In thy not chiding; for she was as tender</p>
			<p class="verseline">As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,</p>

			<p class="character">Paulina</p>

			<p class="verseline">As now she might have done,</p>
			<p class="verseline">So much to my good comfort as it is</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,</p>

			<p class="verseline">As now it coldly stands- when first I wooâ€™d her!</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am ashamâ€™d. Does not the stone rebuke me</p>
			<p class="verseline">For being more stone than it? O royal piece,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thereâ€™s magic in thy majesty, which has</p>
			<p class="verseline">My evils conjurâ€™d to remembrance, and</p>
			<p class="verseline">From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Standing like stone with thee!</p>
			<p class="character">Perdita</p>
			<p class="verseline">And give me leave,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And do not say â€˜tis superstition that</p>
			<p class="verseline">I kneel, and then implore her blessing. Lady,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Dear queen, that ended when I but began,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Indeed, my lord,</p>
			<p class="verseline">If I had thought the sight of my poor image</p>

			<p class="verseline">Let be, let be.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Would I were dead, but that methinks alreadyâ€”</p>
			<p class="verseline">What was he that did make it? See, my lord,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Would you not deem it breathâ€™d, and that those veins</p>
			<p class="verseline">Did verily bear blood?</p>
			<p class="character">Polixenes</p>
			<p class="verseline">Masterly done!</p>
			<p class="verseline">The very life seems warm upon her lip.</p>
			<p class="character">Leontes</p>

			<p class="character">Paulina</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirrâ€™d you; but</p>
			<p class="verseline">I could afflict you farther.</p>
			<p class="character">Leontes</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do, Paulina;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For this affliction has a taste as sweet</p>
			<p class="verseline">As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,</p>
			<p class="verseline">There is an air comes from her. What fine chisel</p>
			<p class="verseline">Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For I will kiss her.</p>
			<p class="character">Paulina</p>
			<p class="verseline">Good my lord, forbear.</p>
			<p class="verseline">The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Youâ€™ll mar it if you kiss it; stain your own</p>
			<p class="verseline">With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?</p>
			<p class="character">Leontes</p>
			<p class="verseline">No, not these twenty years.</p>
			<p class="character">Perdita</p>
			<p class="verseline">So long could I</p>

			<p class="character">Paulina</p>
			<p class="verseline">Either forbear,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you</p>

			<p class="verseline">Iâ€™ll make the statue move indeed, descend,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And take you by the hand, but then youâ€™ll thinkâ€”</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which I protest against- I am assisted</p>

			<p class="character">Leontes</p>
			<p class="verseline">What you can make her do</p>
